          p The Oakland University Social Work has had a huge impact on my life. These past two years have been some of the best years of my life. I have been given the opportunity to grow and develop not just as a professional but also as a person. The opportunities presented by the program have been endless and I have tried to take advantage of as much as possible! Every since the day that I got my acceptance letter for this program in the mail I have constantly been able to try new things.
          p Getting the opportunity to be a student leader would not have happened without the social work program. I also would not have been able to study abroad in Europe which was a life changing experience. I thank every single one of my teachers for inspiring me on a daily basis through their passion for social justice. I also thank my fellow students for pushing my beliefs and sharing their experiences so that I could learn from them as well.
